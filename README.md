# PPM-Image-Manipulation
A program capable of applying various image effects to PPM images.

Program will first ask for a filename, which is assumed to be an image of the .ppm format. The program will then allow you to apply any combination of the following effects:

1) Remove Red
2) Remove Green
3) Remove Blue
4) Negate Red
5) Negate Green
6) Negate Blue
7) Add Noise
8) High Contrast
9) Grayscale

Once the user is done applying effects (signaled by entering "0",) the program will output the edited image to a file named edited_[filename].ppm
